    <h2>Welcome to my Twisted Restaurant</h2>
    <p>We have been expecting you... *mwahahaha*</p>
    <p>Our story begins in 2015, the year we moved to Hanoi to escape the decaying imperial core of our forebears. 
    We hadn't met yet but on opposite sides of the ancient city we were schemin' in similar ways.
    We were fully prepared to "hit a lick" so to speak. 
    Through the people we met and the food we ate, Hanoi got us bad.</p>
    <p>A year later, we found each other and discovered a mutual affection for Bun Dau... Mien Tron... things of that nature.
    We argued over our favorite spots for Com Rang or Banh Mi.
    We began to cook meals for each other which were poor approximations of the dishes we had fallen in love with.
    We fell in love with each other too it turns out!
    Over time, our technique improved... Know what I'm saying?
    I mean, we were fine tuning our dinners as we did our lesson plans.
    Oh yes, we were ESL teachers too... Tough racket!
    Slowly but surely, we came to the conclusion that we should probably get married and open a restaurant.
    Before we could realize this plan of ours we moved about the globe some more, collecting bits of seasoning here and there.
    Along the way, we also realized the contradictions between our politics and starting a business.
    Ultimately, we found ourselves back where we started.</p>
    <p>When we finally decided to open up a restaurant, we knew we were reproducing a pattern that we wanted to break.
    We stand in solidarity with the global proletariat and all oppressed peoples of the world.
    We support all attempts to build socialism and a nation's right to self-determination.
    We uphold scientific socialism and dialectical materialism as the basis for understanding history.
    We also want to make a bomb ass vegan pizza for the comrades.</p>
    <p>With all of that in mind, we opened up my Twisted Restaurant with two primary goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make delicious vegan food.</li>
        <li>Serve the community.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We would also have to create surplus value, of course, but through the robust national co-op framework of Vietnam.
    Working together with several local agriculture co-ops, all of our profits go into improving our food and our ability to serve the most vulnerable communities in Hanoi.
    Yes, we are actual vegan communists.
    Oh, and we still continue to teach as well.
    Now we produce dumplings as well as ideology :)
    We wish to struggle with our comrades, not our meals.
    If any of this sounds appealing to you, have a look at our menu.
    It's our favorite food from all of the places we've lived and we've spent over a decade perfecting these dishes.
    It's good, actually. Ask anyone!
